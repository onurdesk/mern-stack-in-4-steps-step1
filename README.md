## Step one

The MERN stack is very similar to that of the popular [MEAN stack](https://onurdesk.com/how-to-create-a-mern-stack-app-in-4-steps-section-1/). The only distinction here is that the MEAN stack uses Angular to construct a front-end web server, and the MERN stack uses [React instead](https://onurdesk.com/8-fascinating-reasons-people-like-react-js/).

The program we’re going to create in this tutorial series is a basic to-do application. Using this example, you will see how to construct a CRUD (Create, Read, Edit , and Delete) application from scratch using the [MEAN stack !](https://onurdesk.com/how-to-create-a-mern-stack-app-in-4-steps-section-1/)

In this first part of this section, we will complete the setup of the React project to create the front-end part of the MERN stack sample program. In the next section, we’re going to continue integrating the [Node.js/Express](https://onurdesk.com/how-to-create-a-mern-stack-app-in-4-steps-section-1/) server.
